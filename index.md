# 1. This staking pool is non-profit, 2% fee is charged to cover basic power cost.
# 2. Although fee is lower than most pools, the performance is as good as top pools.
# 3. When huobi? When coinbase? Just a joke, I love Aion.
# 4. I operate this pool to secure Aion network.
# 5. Also, I operate this pool to prove that POS can be done on a resource limited device with excellent performance.
